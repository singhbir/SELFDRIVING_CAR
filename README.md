# Self Driving Car

Self Driving Car Using Covolutinal Neural Networks Via Using NVIDIA Model Architecture for End To End Self Driving Car And For Simulation Using Udacity Open Source Unity Self Driving Car Simulator

## Demo

[![Self Driving Car Project](https://github.com/singhbir/SELFDRIVING_CAR/blob/master/selfdriving.PNG)

## Dependencies

+ Keras
+ Pandas
+ Matplotlib
+ Numpy
+ OpenCV
+ SKlearn

## Usage

### Clone this repository

Type the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
cd path/to/directory/
git clone https://github.com/Aman-py/Self_Driving_Car
cd Self_Driving_Car/
```

### Run the pretrained model

Start up the [Udacity self-driving simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim), choose a scene and press the Autonomous Mode button.  Then, run the model as follows:

```python
python Drive.py
```
## Dataset
I have created my own dataset using udacity simulator self driving car training mode and after that i have trained my model on that dataset for convenience you can use my data to train ur model [here](https://github.com/Aman-py/data)
For more good datasets u can check these
+ Udacity: https://medium.com/udacity/open-sourcing-223gb-of-mountain-view-driving-data-f6b5593fbfa5<br>
70 minutes of data ~ 223GB<br>
Format: Image, latitude, longitude, gear, brake, throttle, steering angles and speed<br>
