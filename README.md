## Dependencies

+ Keras
+ Pandas
+ Matplotlib
+ Numpy
+ OpenCV
+ SKlearn

## Usage

### Clone this repository

Type the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
cd path/to/directory/
git clone https://github.com/Aman-py/Self_Driving_Car
cd Self_Driving_Car/
```

### Run the pretrained model

Start up the [Udacity self-driving simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim), choose a scene and press the Autonomous Mode button.  Then, run the model as follows:

```python
python Drive.py
```
## Dataset
I have created my own dataset using udacity simulator self driving car training mode and after that i have trained my model on that dataset for convenience you can use my data to train ur model [here](https://github.com/Aman-py/data)
For more good datasets u can check these
+ Udacity: https://medium.com/udacity/open-sourcing-223gb-of-mountain-view-driving-data-f6b5593fbfa5<br>
70 minutes of data ~ 223GB<br>
Format: Image, latitude, longitude, gear, brake, throttle, steering angles and speed<br>
